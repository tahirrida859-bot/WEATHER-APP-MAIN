# Frontend Mentor - Weather app

![Design preview for the Weather app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Build a weather app using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Getting started

### What's included

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

**In your download:**
- Mobile and desktop designs (JPG format)
- All required assets in the `/assets` folder
- Variable and static font files (or link to Google Fonts)
- `style-guide.md` with colors, fonts, and other design specs

**Want more accurate builds?** The designs are in JPG static format, which means you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. If you'd like the Figma design file to help build a more accurate solution faster, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

### API setup

This project uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather data.

**Good news:** Open-Meteo is completely free and doesn't require an API key! You can start making requests right away.

- **API Documentation:** [https://open-meteo.com/en/docs](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
- **No rate limits** for reasonable personal use
- Example endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current_weather=true`

Check their documentation for all available weather parameters and location search capabilities.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

**We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one.** We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code. The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform and share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of our [community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community)
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).
